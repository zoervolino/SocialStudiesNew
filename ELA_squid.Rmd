<h3>for example:</h3>

Select a Quotation: 
<h4>- "As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds /
Had been incorporate. So we grew together /
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, /
But yet an union in partition, /
Two lovely berries molded on one stem..." (A Midsummer Night's Dream, 3.2, 97)</h4>

Understand: 
<h4>Helena employs the analogy of a double cherry to describe the intimate relationship she shares with Hermia, and, in doing so, simultaneously highlights the shared experience of the two, in addition to their individuality.</h4> 

Identify: <h4>This metaphor works in context to emphasize the betrayal that Helena feels in having her lover suddenly turn his attention towards her lifelong friend.</h4>

Demonstrate Signficance: <h4>In comparing Hermia and Helena's relationship to that of "[t]wo lovely berries molded on one stem," Shakespeare highlights how the womens' friendship occupies a unique position that oscillates between one conjoined entity and two individual beings.

<br>This rhetorical construction underscores the betrayal that Helena feels upon discovering that her former lover has redirected his affections towards Hermia.</h4>
